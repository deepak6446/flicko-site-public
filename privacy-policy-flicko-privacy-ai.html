          Welcome to FlickO Private AI ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed
          to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information

            provide any personal information to use the App.
          </li>
          <li>

        </h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Offline Usage:</strong> All AI interactions occur locally on
            your device. We do not collect, store, or upload any data from your
            conversations with the AI models to our servers.

          <li>
            <strong>Model Downloads:</strong> When you choose to download AI
            models, the App connects to external servers (e.g., Hugging Face) to
            retrieve the models. During this process, standard network data may
            be transmitted, such as your IP address, to the third-party server.
